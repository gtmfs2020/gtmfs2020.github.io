<h3 id="fila cordy">Attack trees: meaning, analysis, and correctness</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://people.irisa.fr/Barbara.Kordy">Barbara Fila (Kordy)</a> – IRISA</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract</em>. Since their introduction in 1999, attack trees have become one of the most popular models for representation of security issues. They have been successfully adopted by industry where they are employed to evaluate the security of systems and organizations. More recently, attack trees attracted the attention of formal methods scientists interested in their meaning, their automated creation, and their potential for quantitative analysis of security.</p>
<p>This talk will focus on three practical aspects related to attack tree modeling and analysis. We will be first interested in attack trees with repeated nodes representing attacker's actions that may contribute to several distinct attack vectors. Next, we will investigate the problem of multi-parameter security analysis with attack trees. Finally, we will develop a semantics allowing us to verify the quality of an attack tree with respect to the system to be analyzed.</p>
<p>This presentation will be based on my joint research work with Wojciech Widel, Sophie Pinchinat, and Maxime Audinot.</p>
<h3 id="rakotonirina">Efficient verification of observational equivalences in finite-process calculi</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://members.loria.fr/IRakotonirina/">Itsaka Rakotonirina</a> – INRIA - LORIA</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract</em>. Security protocols are distributed programs used for circulating information remotely, especially for sensitive applications such as online banking, electronic voting–or any internet connection to any website. These protocols are notoriously hard to design and have a long history of flawed structures, making it possible for external parties controlling the communication network to bypass their security. In this work we are interested in automated proofs that a given protocol is privacy preserving for a chosen notion of privacy, and number of users. Such properties are usually modelled as behavioural equivalences in concurrent process calculi (e.g. variants of the pi-calculus). We implement the DeepSec prover, an automated tool deciding such equivalences, as well as powerful optimisations that reduced its verification time by several orders of magnitude by exploiting the process symmetries that naturally arise during practical verification.</p>
<h3 id="hritcu">When Good Components Go Bad: Formally Secure Compilation Despite Dynamic Compromise</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu/">Cătălin Hrițcu</a> – INRIA</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract</em>. We propose a new formal criterion for evaluating secure compartmentalization schemes for unsafe languages like C and C++, expressing end-to-end security guarantees for software components that may become compromised after encountering undefined behavior—for example, by accessing an array out of bounds. Our criterion is the first to model dynamic compromise in a system of mutually distrustful components with clearly specified privileges. It articulates how each component should be protected from all the others—in particular, from components that have encountered undefined behavior and become compromised. To illustrate the model, we construct a secure compilation chain for a small unsafe language with buffers, procedures, and components, targeting a simple abstract machine with built-in compartmentalization. We propose a novel proof technique and give a machine-checked proof in Coq that this compiler satisfies our secure compilation criterion. Finally, we show that the protection guarantees offered by the compartmentalized abstract machine can be achieved at the machine-code level using either software fault isolation or a tag-based reference monitor.</p>
<p><em>Catalin Hritcu is a researcher at Inria Paris where he works on security foundations. He is particularly interested in formal methods for security (secure compilation, compartmentalization, memory safety, security protocols, integrity, information flow), programming languages (program verification, proof assistants, type systems, semantics, formal metatheory, certified tools, property-based testing), and the design and verification of security-critical systems (reference monitors, secure compilation chains, secure hardware). He was awarded an ERC Starting Grant on formally secure compilation (<a href="https://secure-compilation.github.io">https://secure-compilation.github.io</a>), and is also actively involved in the design of the F* verification system (<a href="https://www.fstar-lang.org/">https://www.fstar-lang.org/</a>), which is used for building a formally verified HTTPS stack (<a href="https://project-everest.github.io">https://project-everest.github.io</a>). Catalin received a PhD from Saarland University in Saarbrücken, a Habilitation from ENS Paris, and was previously also a Research Associate at University of Pennsylvania and a Visiting Researcher at Microsoft Research Redmond.</em></p>
<h3 id="letan">Specifying and Verifying Hardware-based Security Enforcement mechanisms</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://github.com/lthms">Thomas Letan</a> – ANSSI</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract</em>. In this talk, we focus on Hardware-based Security Enforcement (HSE) mechanisms, when trusted software components configure hardware mechanisms to constrain the execution of untrusted —and arbitrary– software components. Over the past decade, several critical vulnerabilities have been disclosed which specifically target HSE mechanisms and which leveraged errors in the specifications of the underlying hardware mechanisms rather than inconsistencies in the implementation.</p>
<p>We discuss our motivations to apply formal methods to this particular use case, and our related contributions. Initiated in late 2014, our work is in line with ongoing efforts to increase the robustness of commodity hardware architectures (e.g., ARM formal specification by Reid et al.).</p>
